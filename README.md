# RayTracing Engine

Created by Heiner Le√≥n & Luis Alvarado

##Overview

This Ray Tracing engine is an open source project, licenced under MIT licence, created as part of the course "Introduction to Computer Graphics" at Costa Rican Institute of Technology (TEC).

Using <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1997-98/ray-tracing/types.html">Backward Ray technique</a> and <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~sugih/courses/eecs487/lectures/16-Phong+Shading.pdf">Phong shading</a>, it provides the necessary for any user to create a 3D scene using geometric primitives and light sources.

##Features

- Geometric Primitives
  - Spheres
  - Polygons
  - Cylinders
  - Cones
  - Disks
- Ligh sources
  - Attenuation factor.
  - Environment lighting.
- Material propieties for objects
  - Diffuse reflection.
  - Specular/Mirror reflection.
- Textures Mapping (Work in progress. See <a href="https://github.com/hleon12/RayTracing-Engine/issues/4">#4</a> <a href="https://github.com/hleon12/RayTracing-Engine/issues/5">#5</a>).

##Usage

The scenes has to be described in a .3d file using own declarative language. It uses a simple parser, but in the future it'll be a complete language with its own compiler (See <a href="https://github.com/hleon12/RayTracing-Engine/issues/3">#3</a>). Meanwhile, use the example in /examples for guidance.

Tested on macOS and Linux using gcc.

```
$ make
$ ./raytracing <file.3d>
```

The output is an AVS file. We recommend <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">Image Magick</a> for viewing and exporting to other formats. We'll support more common formats in the future (See <a href="https://github.com/hleon12/RayTracing-Engine/issues/10">#10</a>).
